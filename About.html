                    <p>Carter Banks is someone who loves staying active and having fun. He started playing hockey when he was 18, during his senior year of high school, and quickly got hooked on the sport. What he enjoys most about hockey is skating; there’s nothing quite like gliding across the rink and feeling the speed of the game. About a year ago, he decided to try volleyball, and it quickly became another passion. Carter plays hockey three days a week and volleyball two days a week, always striving to improve and keep up with his teammates. One of his proudest achievements is learning how to snap the ball in volleyball, a skill that took time to master but gave him a great sense of accomplishment. Looking ahead, one of his biggest goals is to play in a Division 1 roller hockey game for his school.</p>
